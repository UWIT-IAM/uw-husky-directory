## UW-Directory Pull Request checklist

- [ ] A corresponding Github Issue has been created in [this repository](https://github.com/UWIT-IAM/uw-husky-directory/issues) to track this work
- [ ] I have run `poetry run tox`
- [ ] I have selected a `semver-guidance:` label for this pull request (under labels,
      to the right of the screen)
- 
If you do not do both of these things, your checks will either not run, or have a high probability of failing.
