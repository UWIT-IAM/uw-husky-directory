## Getting Access to PWS

If you want to test functionality locally, you must have a signed UWCA certificate 
for a domain that has access (e.g., `yournetid.cac.washington.edu`).

Developer access should be limited to the `eval` PWS instance. 

For more information on enrolling and certificate requirements, follow the [PWS Onboarding Guide].

***Note: If you are a UW-IT IAM developer, you may already have access!***
