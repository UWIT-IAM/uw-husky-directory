# builds an image that will match the image used by our CI exactly. This will also invoke the
# dev validation tests (scripts/validate-development-image.sh) within the image, as a
# pretty good guarantee that your push will result in a successful post-push workflow.
#
# To run this, simply do:

   Use: pre-push.sh [--version VERSION --test]

   Blackens all code, builds a docker image from the code, then
   runs all validations to ensure that the application is functioning
   appropriately.

   You must run this in "--test" mode unless your git branch is
   clean (i.e., ready to push). Running without "--test" amends your
   commit after blackening all code, so the utility protects you from amending
   a previous commit accidentally.

   You cannot opt out of blackening the code; our CI pipeline will do this for you
   even if you skip this step. It is recommended to always run this command
   before pushing to save the trouble of waiting for the workflow to fail.

   Options:

   --test          Run all validations even if some fail;
                   do not amend the HEAD commit to blacken code.
                   Use this until you're ready to actually push.

   -v, --version   Tag an application version. (i.e., -v TAG_NAME).
                   Use with --test to build release candidates locally for
                   remote testing. The image will be stored locally
                   as ${REPO_HOST}/${REPO_PROJECT}/${APP_NAME}:TAG_NAME

   --headless      Do not run docker in interactive mode; required when running
                   via remote automation (i.e., Github Actions)

   --quiet         Disables most output
   -h, --help      Show this message and exit
