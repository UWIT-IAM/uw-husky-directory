#!/usr/bin/env sh

# This script does some sanity checks on your code base, autoformats our code using 'black', and
# builds an image that will match the image used by our CI exactly. This will also invoke the
# dev validation tests (scripts/validate-development-image.sh) within the image, as a
# pretty good guarantee that your push will result in a successful post-push workflow.
#
# To run this, simply do:
#   ./scripts/pre-push.sh
#
# If successful, this script will create (or replace) the file .pre_push/last in your current directory.
# This contains some helpful environment variables for referencing your commit and push.
# You can import those at any time using: 'source .pre_push/last'
#
# The variables themselves are used in some helpful output, so that you can copy and paste the output directly to
# execute other steps.
#
# Following is a list of environment variables exported by .pre_push/last:
#   - COMMIT_SHA: A string containing the first 10 characters of the commit SHA for when this script last succeeded.
#                 This can be a useful way to construct meaningful commits. See docs/commits.md.
#                 Example value: ab1c234de5
#                 How to use it:  git reset ${COMMIT_SHA}
#
#   - COMMIT_TAG: A string that contains only the tag name created from your commit message. Useful for comparing to
#                 to see when your last commit image is from (i.e., at which commit you last ran this script).
#                 Use this if you want to search for the tag somewhere.
#                 Example value: commit-ab1c234de5
#
#   - COMMIT_IMAGE: A string of the fully qualified image name for this commit. You can push this somewhere if you like,
#                   or use it to tag another image.
#                   Example value: uwitiam/husky-directory:commit-ab1c234de5
#                   How to use it: docker run -it "${COMMIT_IMAGE}"
#
#   - PERSONAL_IMAGE: A string similar to COMMIT_IMAGE, but with a tag including your current environment username.
#                          Example value: uwitiam/husky-directory:personal-foobar
#                          If you wish for the base to use a different personal name, export or set the
#                          PERSONAL_IMAGE_SUFFIX environment variable. (e.g., PERSONAL_IMAGE_SUFFIX=justfoo)
#                          Use this to maintain an image for some personal use case, or deployment environment.
#                          How to use it: docker tag "${COMMIT_IMAGE}" "${PERSONAL_IMAGE}" \
#                                             && docker push "${PERSONAL_IMAGE}"
