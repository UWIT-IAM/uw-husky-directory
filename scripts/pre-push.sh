# This script does some sanity checks on your code base, autoformats our code using 'black', and
# builds an image that will match the image used by our CI exactly. This will also invoke the
# dev validation tests (scripts/validate-development-image.sh) within the image, as a
# pretty good guarantee that your push will result in a successful post-push workflow.
#
# To run this, simply do:
#   ./scripts/pre-push.sh
#
# If successful, this script will create (or replace) the file .pre_push/last in your current directory.
# This contains some helpful environment variables for referencing your commit and push.
# You can import those at any time using: 'source .pre_push/last'
#
# The variables themselves are used in some helpful output, so that you can copy and paste the output directly to
# execute other steps.
