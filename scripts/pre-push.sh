# This script does some validation checks on our code base,
# auto-formats our code using 'black', and
# builds an image that will match the image used by our CI exactly.
# Validation tests (scripts/validate-development-image.sh) are invoked from
# within the image itself pretty good guarantee that your push will result in a
# successful post-push workflow.
#
# To run this, simply do:
#   ./scripts/pre-push.sh --test  # Run any time!
#   ./scripts/pre-push.sh         # Run once your commit is ready
#   ./scripts/pre-push.sh --version 1.2.3  # Prepares a release image for docker push

   Use: pre-push.sh [--version VERSION --test]

   Blackens all code, builds a docker image from the code, then
   runs all validations to ensure that the application is functioning
   appropriately.

   You must run this in "--test" mode unless your git branch is
   clean (i.e., ready to push). Running without "--test" amends your
   commit after blackening all code, so the utility protects you from amending
   a previous commit accidentally.

   You cannot opt out of blackening the code; our CI pipeline will do this for you
   even if you skip this step. It is recommended to always run this command
   before pushing to save the trouble of waiting for the workflow to fail.

   Options:

   --test          Run all validations even if some fail;
                   do not amend the HEAD commit to blacken code.
                   Use this until you're ready to actually push.

   -k, --skip-auto-format
                   Use this if you don't want to pre-blacken
                   your code. Note: this will not prevent a style
                   check from failing validations!

   -v, --version   Tag an application version. (i.e., -v TAG_NAME).
                   Use with --test to build release candidates locally for
                   remote testing. The image will be stored locally
                   as ${REPO_HOST}/${REPO_PROJECT}/${APP_NAME}:TAG_NAME

   --no-cache      Do not cache the resulting images in our docker repository.
                   When running with --test, this is always implied. You may want
                   to set this if you have a slow internet connection and don't want
                   to pre-push the fingerprinted images.

   --headless      Do not run docker in interactive mode; required when running
                   via remote automation (i.e., Github Actions)

   --quiet         Disables most output
   -h, --help      Show this message and exit
   -g, --debug     Show commands as they are executing
